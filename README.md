This package allows to efficiently compute the residual errors (in the least squares sense) of *all* the possible polynomial models on *all* (or all the ones starting at some point) subsegments of some data. So it solves the regression problem of finding a polynomial P minimizing ∑ᵢ (P(xᵢ)-yᵢ)² for some data x₁,...,xₙ, y₁,...,yₙ; but doesn't actually compute the polynomial and instead only returns the optimal target value.
